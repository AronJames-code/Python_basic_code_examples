The files in Python_basic_code_examples are simply little bits of code that I created as practice for myself while reviewing python. 
Some of these include nice libraries and functions like the time library or random library that many people may have overlooked or never even learned about when starting their coding adventure.
Anyone who is new to coding may find these file as solid resources with explanations included.
